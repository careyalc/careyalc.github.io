## Introduction
The UMSI home page has been deemed “boring”, “short”, and “blue”. Our team has agreed it is the ideal time to revamp our school’s image. To bring greater value to our client, we have decided to make the UMSI homepage more creative and fun. Our team will conduct a comparative evaluation of the home pages of different information schools in the U.S. so we better understand the content perspective students are expecting from a nationally high-ranked university. For additional value, we will be sending out surveys to students in order to validate our comparative evaluation.

# Part I. Competitor Analysis

## Methods
For comparative evaluation analyses, we viewed the top 5 Information programs in the U.S. on the U.S. News & Rankings website. We then visited the websites of Syracuse University’s School of Information (ranked #4) and University of Illinois’s School of Information (ranked #1) for comparison with the University of Michigan’s School of Information (ranked #5). We also visited the OTIS design school website for inspiration on how design meets information (i.e., better visual design). Using real-time board, we compared the three School of Information websites (i.e., Syracuse University, University of Illinois and University of Michigan) side-by-side noting both the positive and negative features of each website. We also noted aspects of the OTIS Design School website that could inform the design of the SI website. The comparative analysis between the three sites helped inform the development of our survey for UMSI prospective students to better understand which features and content is most pertinent during program search and application process.

## Findings 
During our task of looking for ways to improve the current University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI) website we decided to look at websites of other schools of information and similar programs across the United States.  We decided to use the U.S. News and World Report rankings of schools of information as a starting point in our evaluation.

According to the 2017 rankings of graduate schools of information the University of Michigan ranked fifth out of all the graduate schools of information.  We decided to compare the UMSI website to two other schools on this list.  We decided to compare UMSI to direct competitors, which included the top ranked school on the rankings, University of Illinois – Urbana Champaign (UIUC), and a school ranked just one position higher at fourth, Syracuse University (SU).  We also found a website of an indirect competitor, OTIS Art/Design, whose website had several design features that we felt could be implemented into the overall UMSI website design.

When comparing all of these websites there are a few similarities, such as all implement some top-bar navigation categories that utilizes a drop-down hover navigation from this menu.  (Photo examples in the RealTimeBoard in the Appendix)
We really liked how both the UIUC, SU, and OTIS have scrolling images and videos that displays different aspects of student life and/or student projects to give visitors, especially prospective students, to the website an idea of what to expect and examples of the type of work that the school can train them to produce.  We liked how the OTIS website used various icons to cleanly and simplistically display information about the school that they wanted to make sure people knew about their school.  These included the ranking of various programs, a virtual tour, and how to stay in touch with them.

All the direct competitors to, and UMSI itself, use a lot of text on their websites.  This led to websites like UIUC being cluttered and causing people to have to hunt for information they wanted.  In this respect OTIS, although not a direct competitor, does a great job of using tiles and images to reduce the amount of text on the website, while still being able to get their desired message across to visitors, and more specifically prospective students.

**Mode of Survey:** Online

**Method:** Survey was populated with questions regarding demographic information. We then generated questions aimed at understanding how students gather information about programs, how they interact with the UMSI website, program interests (e.g., Career Aspirations, Curriculum, Faculty Information, Scholarship, etc.), specific website content, and mode of website access (e.g., mobile or laptop).  There is a total of 19 questions. The survey was sent out on Wednesday, 3/28/2018, and closed Friday, 4/06/2018.

## Findings
Our Survey data revealed that the majority (~90%) of the respondents felt that they were very comfortable with navigating the internet with around 4% stating they were slightly or very uncomfortable with it.

We asked respondents to rank what type of information they seek from the UMSI website, from a list containing Career Aspirations, Curriculum Requirements, Degrees and Majors offered, Faculty Information, Scholarship Information/Financial Aid, Student Projects, Tuition Cost, and School News and Events. 
Information about Curriculum Requirements, Degrees and Majors offered and Career Aspirations were ranked the highest.

Almost 97% of our respondents said they use a laptop or a desktop computer to access the UMSI website as opposed to a mobile/tablet device.

When asked the question “What do you find appealing about other school websites that you do not find appealing about the UMSI website?” we found the following responses appear multiple times:
* Minimalistic design
* Ease of navigation
* Chat support or phone contact information
* Easy access to class information/course guides
* Large images/less text
* The UX of the website is innovative and creative
* Clarity and organization
* Details about what courses are offered when
* Clearer links between sections and clear definition between MSI and BSI program offer
 
Areas where UMSI could improve include:
* Accessibility. The lack of alt text, presence of broken links, and misuse of headings is unacceptable.
* An option to subscribe to an events calendar
* Representation of the variety of specializations in UMSI, and not just highlighting a few trendy things
* More consistent links
* Get rid of ugly colors
* Removal of outdated links
* Professor listing and their office hours



## Recommendations

To make the UMSI homepage more attractive, "fun", and coherent, we have a number of recommendations. 

### Recommendation One: Improve Overall Visual Design of Homepage
Instead of a slideshow of still images on a solid background, have a slideshow of moving images and video clips at the top of home screen. This will give the viewer a sneak peak into student life, school work, research projects, and experiences in UMSI. The moving images will attract the visitor's eye as well, just like walking into a store with a wall of big-screen tvs, it keeps your attention. 

Furthermore, the content featured on the UMSI home page needs to be updated and changed to feature categories prospective and current students are interested in. The homepage is prime real estate for valuable information and the many selling points of UMSI. The amount of space occupied by the UMSI Twitter feed could be better utilized as described below. The News and Events portions are bulky with text and completely skimmed over by viewers. The following paragraphs explain a recommendation for a more modern, informative, relevant, and attractive UMSI homepage. The link to the RealTimeBoard with complete photo examples of the competitors and an example homepage with updated and desired content is available in the Appendix.

### Recommendation Two: Improve Website Navigation
The first thing the homepage should show are navigation tools for quick access to important information, including how to donate, apply, programs of study, and resources for current students. The image should exemplify student life and achievements, as recommended above. Scrolling down the page should be a few bragging rights of UMSI like national rankings and job placement and satisfaction after graduation. Quick information that according to surveys, can influence the decisions of prospective students. This information is especially influential for international students who are not concerned with in-state versus out-of-state tuition rates. 

Scrolling down further should be quick links for prospective students to jump to pages that provide how to apply, financial aid and tuition information, and program/curriculum information. Following that should be sections on career outlook and alumni achievements to highlight the interesting careers and successes of UMSI graduates. Prospective students should be reassured that UMSI will prepare them for a career that is anything but ordinary.  

The bottom of the page should feature up-to-date research projects that students are able to or currently working on. Most of the research projects featured on UMSI's website are completed which implies there are not research projects or opportunities at the moment. A brief listing of upcoming workshops, like the ones for Python and R, and upcoming UMSI events should come just before the second donation link at the end. 

Our second recommendation is to keep a simplified bar menu across the top of the screen so as the user scrolls down the home page, they can quickly open navigation tabs.  This will ease navigation and make it easier to find information once they decide what they are looking for. When a website user is on a mission and knows what information they are seeking, 3 clicks of the mouse is the goal to reduce frustration. 

### Recommendation Three: Change Color Scheme
Finally, the UMSI homepage should move away from the dark blue background. A softer, brighter color themed webpage would give the visitors a softer greeting. The dark blue is intense and should have more variety in the color scheme to make it more cheerful and appealing.

## Discussion
Some considerations for the comparative evaluation: we only looked at schools within the USNews Ranking, where they aren't ranked on design, but on things like graduation rates and graduate starting salaries. We did not compare the UMSI website to the websites of schools ranked lower than UMSI. These websites may have better features, even though they do not have better programs. 

Some considerations for the survey: only 3 students from the provided list responded. We did not have access to prospective students to survey.  Most of the survey respondents were current UMSI students, undergraduate senior year through second year graduate, who may have a different perspective than freshman who recently researched/applied to SI schools.
The survey had technical difficulties where ranking questions did not function in Firefox browsers. This may have influenced results because students would not be able to respond to these questions, but only submit them as displayed.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the UMSI homepage is in need of an update focus should be on navigation, content, and visual appeal. Our competitors' websites each have strengths and weaknesses, but give inspiration for features UMSI can pick and choose from.  The survey results support our findings on improving the ease of finding important information, the content that is available needs to be updated, and the dark color scheme needs to be brightened up.  We are enthused to see the outcome of this project and hope this report gives you valuable insight into the features of UMSI competitors as well as the interests of website users.
