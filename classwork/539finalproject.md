# 539 Final Project : Accessibility Checklist

## Website: https://umma.umich.edu/

For my final project, I am evaluating The University of Michigan Museum of Art's website. Below is my evaulation of the site using the Vox Media Accessbility checklist.

Though the first four items are checked, I want to make a few notes for some:

1. Though I ran each page through the WAVE validator, and most pages were fine, at least 8 errors occured on all pages due to the menu (saying there was an unlinked item) and the images on the page which included no alt text. Additionally, errors occured from the social icons, saying the link contained no text.

2. Tabbing through the site works well, and it makes sense of how to get through each headding (there are a lot of options in the navigation, so it was a long process getting through each link, however.) Furthermore, sometimes, especially towards the bottom of the page with a lot of large images/buttons, I lost where the tab index was. 

3. The many menu options made it a little tiresome to tab through and use the screenreader for. Furthermore, since the images contain no alt text, once the screen reader made it to the images, it again took a long time, since the screen reader read aloud the full link of the image. 


## Recommendations 
To improve the quality assurance of the UMMA's site I recommend 3 key suggestions:

1. Add alternative text to all images so that screen readers can access them gracefully, and so if an image does not load, it is not left blank. 

2. Change the format of the social icons so screen readers can see them rather than having the user tab into the "group" instead. 

3. If possible, ix the "Art" heading so the screen reader actually says "Art" rather than "A-R-T".
